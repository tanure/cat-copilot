## Install 🚀

### Option A: Global install from local repo

```powershell
npm install -g .
catpilot
```

### Option B: Install from published npm package

```powershell
npm install -g @alberttanure/catpilot-cli@latest
catpilot
```

## Update (no uninstall needed) 🔄

### Recommended: built-in updater

```powershell
catpilot update
```

### Direct npm update

```powershell
npm update -g @alberttanure/catpilot-cli
```

If your shell was opened before the update, restart it to refresh PATH/shims.

## Doctor (one-shot diagnostics) 🩺

Use doctor when `/agents` does not show `CatPilot`:

```powershell
catpilot doctor
```

It checks:
- plugin root and packaged assets
- presence of `plugin.json`
- presence of `agents/*.agent.md`
- `copilot --version` availability

### Requirements

- Node.js 18+
- GitHub Copilot CLI installed and available in PATH (`copilot`)

## Quickstart (60 seconds) ⚡

1. Run `catpilot`
2. Trigger setup with `setup catpilot` (or first write intent)
3. Answer prompts:
   - storage root
   - partitioning (`day`/`week`/`month`)
   - migration (`adopt`/`copy`/`move`)
4. Start using prompts:
   - `add a task to prepare monthly review`
   - `add journal entry: shipped milestone checks`
   - `summarize my day and save it`

Outputs are emoji-enhanced for fast scanning and fun interaction.

## Prompt Examples 💬

```

## How Storage Works 🗂️

CatPilot resolves targets from `data/config.json`.

Key settings (see also `data/config.template.json`):
- `storage.root`
- `storage.partitioning`: `day`, `week`, `month`
- `migration.mode`: `adopt`, `copy`, `move`

If config is missing/invalid and a write is requested, CatPilot triggers interactive setup automatically.

## Publish to npm 📦

Yes — you need an npm account to publish.

1. Create account at npmjs.com and verify email.
2. Login:

```powershell
npm login
```

3. (Recommended) Dry run package contents:

```powershell
npm pack --dry-run
```

4. Publish:

```powershell
npm publish --access public
```

Notes:
- You can publish only package names/scopes you own.
- You cannot publish under `@github/*` unless you own that npm scope.

## Troubleshooting 🧯

- `❌ copilot not found`: install GitHub Copilot CLI and re-open terminal.
- `⚠️ /agents does not show CatPilot`:
   - run `catpilot doctor`
   - run `copilot --version` (upgrade if outdated)
   - run `catpilot update`
   - restart terminal/session and retry `/agents`
   - run with `CATPILOT_DEBUG=1 catpilot` to print plugin root + discovered agent files
- `⚠️ setup loops`: validate JSON format in `data/config.json`.
- `⚠️ writes in wrong place`: ask CatPilot to show current storage config.
- `❌ npm publish fails`: check package name availability and npm auth.
